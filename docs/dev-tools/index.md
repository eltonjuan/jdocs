# Developer Tools

In order to facilitate developers using the Juno framework, we have created several tools that are specifically designed to enhance your workflow. We recommend the following:

## Sublime Packages

Personally, we love [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3), and therefore we have created a few Sublime packages to support you in your development.

### DustBuster
Since Juno uses [Dust.js by LinkedIn](http://www.dustjs.com/) as our templating engine, you'll want to install a handy package called [DustBuster](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/DustBuster). DustBuster will make your Dust files look pretty with a custom Dust syntax definition, as well as helpful Dust code completions and additional Dust reference links. A full list of DustBuster completions can be viewed [here](https://github.com/zanuka/dust-buster/blob/master/docs/completions.md).

### JunoCommander
For additional code completions specific to JavaScript and Dust development in Juno, install [JunoCommander](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/JCommander). Supported completions include, [dust](https://github.com/zanuka/jcommander/blob/master/usage/jdust-completions.dust), [js](https://github.com/zanuka/jcommander/blob/master/usage/jjs-snippets.js) and [tests](https://github.com/zanuka/jcommander/blob/master/usage/jjs-snippets.js)

## Other tools

### Juno CLI
The Juno command line interface (CLI) is a powerful tool that can be used to scaffold a new site in Juno, upgrade an existing site, create new ViewComponents and Services, as well as scaffold out unit tests. See [Juno CLI](/docs/juno-cli/) for more information.

### Juno Copilot (coming soon)
Juno Copilot is a custom DevTools extension useful for debugging the Juno framework. It has many features to help you inspect and debug your Juno site. Additional information, as well as the full feature set, can be found [here](#).
