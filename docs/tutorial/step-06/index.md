# Final Words

Congratulations on building your first site in Juno! We've covered a lot of topics in this tutorial, so don't worry if you need to revisit some of the steps again to brush up on the key concepts of the Juno framework. 

## Next Steps

In the scheme of things, the TodoMVC application that we built in this tutorial is relatively simple. We only have one component inside of the shell (TodoList). In the real world, your application would have many more components, often nested inside of other components! Component composition is an extremely powerful tool when building user interfaces in the web. 

We recommend reading through the remainder of the documentation to see how more complex web applications are constructed using the Juno framework!
