# Tutorial

In our tutorial, we'll be building an implementation of the infamous [TodoMVC](http://www.todomvc.com) application in Juno. This tutorial will touch on several important pieces of the Juno framework including: 

- Shells
- Routing
- View Components
- API Components
- Events
- UI State and DOM Updates

### Short on time? 
Skip the tutorial and check out the [source](http://stash.nikedev.com/projects/JUNO/repos/juno-tutorial/browse). It's all on Stash.

## Getting Started
The rest of this page will go over how to get your local machine ready for development. Once you are up and running, you can get started with the individual steps of the tutorial! 

### Download juno-tutorial
The first step is to clone the **juno-tutorial** repo by running the following command: 
```bash
$ git clone ssh://git@stash.nikedev.com/juno/juno-tutorial.git
```


### Install Node.js
If you don't already have Node.js installed on your local machine, head over to [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org) and follow the instructions to install NodeJS for your operating. Alternatively, if you're using [homebrew](http://www.brew.sh), install Node by running the following command: 

```bash
$ brew install node 
```

### Get started!
Now that you have Node.js on your local machine, we're ready to get started! Head on over to [Step 1](/docs/tutorial/step-01/).
